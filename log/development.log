DEPRECATION WARNING: Method map is deprecated and will be removed in Rails 5.1, as `ActionController::Parameters` no longer inherits from hash. Using this deprecated behavior exposes potential security problems. If you continue to use this method you may be creating a security vulnerability in your app that can be exploited. Instead, consider using one of these documented methods which are not deprecated: http://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.0.3/classes/ActionController/Parameters.html (called from cast_params at /var/lib/gems/2.3.0/gems/activeadmin_settings_cached-2.1.0/lib/activeadmin_settings_cached/coercions.rb:16)
